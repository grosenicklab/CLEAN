## Cornell Longitudinal Electroencephalography And Neurostimulation (CLEAN) pipeline.

This library is a pythonic preprocessing and analysis library for EEG and simultaneous TMS+EEG data, designed specifically for longitudinal data.

This is currently research code under development by the Grosenick and Deisseroth labs. It will be released with full documentation for public use in 2025: for now, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

### Brief useage instructions
After setting relevent analysis parameters in the 'test_config.cfg' configuration file, preprocessing can be run from the command line using 'python preprocessing.py'.
